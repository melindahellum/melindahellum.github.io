My career in the Food Service Industry started at a young age for me and I have been in it ever since.  I have loved to cook and entertain since I was little and continue to do that in my career.  I worked in a couple different restaurants in high school and following graduation attended <a HREF="http://experience.jwu.edu/"> Johnson & Wales University </a> in Rhode Island.  From there I opened and ran my own restaurant for a few years with family.  After the closure of that I moved around and worked at a couple different restaurants until I got the job as Head Chef at <a HREF="http://mainehealth.org/">Waldo County General Hospital <a/>.  It is there that I developed an interest in Nutrition and decided to go back to school, I hope to educate others in leading healthier lifestyles when I graduate from UMaine in December 2019.
