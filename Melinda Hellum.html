<P></P> Thanks for visiting my webpage I am a senior at the University of <a HREF="https://umaine.edu/">Maine <a/> in the Food Science and Human Nutrition Degree Program.  I grew up in a small town outside of Ellsworth, where I recently moved back to.  I have an associates degree in Culinary Arts from Johnson and Wales and over 15 years experience in the food service industry.  For the past 6 years I have been the head Chef at Waldo County General Hospital where I have helped develop their menu to include healthier options and lots of fresh local vegetables. Some other hobbies I have include hunting, fishing,camping and crossfit.  I had an adventure of a life time when I won the Moose Lottery in 2017 and was able to go on my own moose hunt.
